## Equipment

Oven
Nonstick pan (approx 9'' square)
Parchment paper or clean canvas couche
Dutch oven
Cooling rack

## Ingredients

500g flour
500g water
3g instant yeast
10g salt
20g extra virgin olive oil (optional, for flavor), plus some extra to coat pan

## Process

Mix flour, yeast, and salt.  Add water and stir until thoroughly mixed, to a consistency that resembles stiff lumpy pancake batter.

Lightly oil the nonstick pan, and pour the mixture into it.

Cover and let rest for 20 minutes, then fold the dough (see reference above for technique).  Repeat rest-and-fold procedure 2-3 times, until the dough resembles a smooth stretchy gel.

Cover and let rest for 2 hours on countertop, or overnight in the fridge.

Liberally flour parchment paper or couche (wet dough is sticky!).  Gently turn dough out onto paper, and flour the exposed surface to reduce stickiness.  Let rest 2 more hours.

Meanwhile, place dutch oven in oven and preheat to 475F.  Give some extra time for the dutch oven to heat.

Transfer dough into hot dutch oven (see reference above for technique), and cover immediately with lid.  Bake covered for 20 minutes, and then uncovered for 15 more.

Remove bread from oven to cooling rack (you can just flip the dutch oven upside-down).  Let cool for at least 20 minutes.
